(I)n-(s)itu (W)ater (I)sotope (Sa)mpling (S)ystem

This repository contains Hardware (circuit board designs), the respective Firmware and Software (a collection of scripts) that enable the user to control a set of electric solenoid valves and up to two mass flow controllers.

In conjunction with some in-situ gas sampling probes and a cavity ring down spectrometer (CRDS), this should facilitate fully automated long term in-situ measurements of stable water isotopes.

In case you need something that works, please contact me under: stefan.seeger@hydrology.uni-freiburg.de
There are working setups, but the Hardware is completely undocumented (most of my time is spent on getting results, not writing documentations) and the Software is constantly changing.

Right now everything in this repository is still work in progress. A technical note is planned...
