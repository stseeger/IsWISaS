This repository contains Hardware (circuit board designs), the respective Firmware and Software (a collection of scripts) that enable the user to control a set of electric solenoid valves and up to two mass flow controllers.

In conjunction with some in-situ gas sampling probes and a cavity ring down spectrometer (CRDS), this should facilitate fully automated long term in-situ measurements of stable water isotopes.
