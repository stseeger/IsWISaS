The main circuit board is meant to control up to two mass flow controllers and up to 8 solenoid valves.

Each extension circuit board can control up to 8 additional solenoid valves. The main board has one RJ-45 port that can be used to connect to the first extension and each extension has two RJ-45 ports (in and out), so that multiple extensions can be chained together.

The main board has a RJ-45 port which can be used to connect to an extension board which itself can control up to 8 solenoid valves.
