Step 1:
In order to enable your computer to communicate with the Arduino Nano on the main controll board, you need to install the CH34x Serial driver.
Just enter "CH34x Serial driver" into your search engine of choice and select a trustworthy source.
here is one example of a source that works right now (2024-02-07):
https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/assets/_site_/downloads/CH34x_Install_Windows_v3_4.zip
or here (a link to my personal Dropbox, might not work for all eternity):

-------------------------
Step 1.5 (optional but recommended):

In case you just want to run the GUI, you can skip this step, but is recommended if you want to test the functionallity of the hardware independently from the GUI.

Install Arduino IDE :
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
Via the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE you can directly send commands to the Arduino Nano on the IsWISaS main controller board.
Connect main controller Arduino to Computer, chose the correct COM-Port and select a Baud-rate of 9600.
The main controller recognizes three commands "?", "valve" and "flow":

? 
identify: The controller should return its name and version

valve
If called without arguments, the controller should return the currently opened valves.

valve <box>#<valve> [<secondaryBox>#<valve>]
open one or two specific valves at once.
<box> 0 is the main controller, higher numbers (1-15) refer to extensions whose IDs are determined by the red dip switches on the extension boards
<valve> refers to a valve on the respective box
[<secondaryBox>#<valve>] (without the square brackets) is optional and can be used to open a secondary valve. In a simple setup, this option is not used.

flow
If called without arguments, the controller should return the current flow rates (possible range mapped to values between 0 and 255) of the two flow controllers

flow <flowRateA> <flowRateB>
If two numbers (possible ranges mapped between 0 and 255) are passed, they will be used to set the flow rate targets of the two flow controllers.

-------------------------
Step 2:
Install Python 3:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

-------------------------
Step 3:
Install the pySerial module :
press: windows-key + R
enter: cmd
enter: <python> -m pip install pyserial
(<python> should contain the path to the python3 installation, default on the picarro might be the path to python2)

-------------------------
Step 4:
Extract the IsWISaS/Software directory to your Picarro's Desktop
Remove "Desktop>\IsWISaS\Software\temp\serial.cch"
("serial.cch" is meant to remember the Com-Port to which the Arduino is connected. This will be constant once your setup is ready, but It is impossible to tell in advance what the Com-Port will be.
 Without "serial.cch" all available Com-Ports are scanned automatically and the right one will be identified and saved into a new serial.cch and loaded without scanning all available Ports upon subsequent starts of the IsWISaS-GUI)

-------------------------
Step 5:
create a link to the IsWISaS_GUI:
  right click on your desktop -> New -> shortcut
Target:   <path to your python3 executable> GUI_IsWISaS.py
Start in: <path to your Desktop>\IsWISaS\Software\scripts

Step 6:
Now you can adapt the Desktop/IsWISaS/Software/config/valve.cfg to match your setup.

Step 7:
Connect the Arduino Nano of the IsWISaS main controller board to your Computer (using a Mini-USB cable).
Start IsWISaS-GUI by clicking on the shortcut that was created in step 5.
