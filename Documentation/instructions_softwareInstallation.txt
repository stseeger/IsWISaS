Step 1:
In order to enable your computer to communicate with the Arduino Nano on the main controll board, you need to install the CH34x Serial driver.
Just enter "CH34x Serial driver" into your search engine of choice and select a trustworthy source.
here is one example of a source that works right now (2024-02-07):
https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/assets/_site_/downloads/CH34x_Install_Windows_v3_4.zip
or here (a link to my personal Dropbox, might not work for all eternity):
https://www.dropbox.com/s/80woki2fxfcg81h/CH34x_Install_Windows_v3_4.EXE

Step 1.5:
Install Arduino IDE (optional but recommended):
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Step 2:
Install Python 3:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 3:
Install the pySerial module :
press: windows-key + R
enter: cmd
enter: <python> -m pip install pyserial
(<python> should contain the path to the python3 installation, default on the picarro might be the path to python2)

Step 4:
Extract the IsWISaS/Software directory to your Picarro's Desktop
Remove "Desktop>\IsWISaS\Software\temp\serial.cch"
("serial.cch" is meant to remember the Com-Port to which the Arduino is connected. This will be constant once your setup is ready, but It is impossible to tell in advance what the Com-Port will be.
 Without "serial.cch" all available Com-Ports are scanned automatically and the right one will be identified and saved into a new serial.cch and loaded without scanning all available Ports upon subsequent starts of the IsWISaS-GUI)

Step 5:
create a link to the IsWISaS_GUI:
  right click on your desktop -> New -> shortcut
Target:   <path to your python3 executable> GUI_IsWISaS.py
Start in: <path to your Desktop>\IsWISaS\Software\scripts

Step 6:
Now you can adapt the Desktop/IsWISaS/Software/config/valve.cfg to match your setup.

Step 7:
Eventually, you can start the IsWISaS-GUI by clicking on the shortcut you created in step 5.
